-- | A /compositions list/ or /composition tree/ is a list data type
-- where the elements are monoids, and the 'mconcat' of any contiguous sublist can be
-- computed in logarithmic time.
-- A common use case of this type is in a wiki, version control system, or collaborative editor, where each change
-- or delta would be stored in a list, and it is sometimes necessary to compute the composed delta between any two versions.
--
-- This version of a composition list is strictly biased to right-associativity, in that we only support efficient consing
-- to the front of the list. This also means that the 'take' operation can be inefficient. The append operation @a <> b@
-- performs O(a log (a + b)) element compositions, so you want
-- the left-hand list @a@ to be as small as possible.
--
-- For a version of the composition list with the opposite bias, and therefore opposite performance characteristics,
-- see "Data.Compositions.Snoc".
