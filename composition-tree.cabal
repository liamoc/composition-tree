version:             0.2.0.4
synopsis:            Composition trees for arbitrary monoids.
description:         A compositions list or composition tree is a list data type where the elements are monoids, and the mconcat of any contiguous sublist can be computed in logarithmic time. A common use case of this type is in a wiki, version control system, or collaborative editor, where each change or delta would be stored in a list, and it is sometimes necessary to compute the composed delta between any two versions.
